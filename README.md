# Analysis-and-Design-a-Real-System-using-UML
The goal of this project is to analyze and design a whole real software system that can be in use from any local authority service in a city or a town such as the **Municipality** in terms of optimizing the services that the minicipality provides to the people and all the benefits people can receive from their local aythority service, using the UML (Unified Modeling Language). Our analysis and design on this system is focused in the need of the **Technical Service** of the municipality which is responsible for scheduling, studying, building and supervising projects that will be in great benefit to the people and improve radically their every day lives. Additionally, the technical servise is responsible for preserving the public buildings in good condition, keeping the public spaces clean and taking care of all the green fields and areas in the city or town. Thus, this system is developed to be implemented and improve the organizing and managing standards of the technical service.
## Project framework description
At first the technical service is composed of the departments below.
- Department of technical, electromechanical projects and transportations.
- Department of urban planning, environment and civil protection.
- Department of cleaning, recycling and preserving green.  

The software system we have designed performs the below functionalities and has the following features.
- An introductional and welcoming front page with information and able to accept registration data from the citizens and the members of the technical service.
- An electronic database where will be stored all the data from the registration as well as information about the technical service (e.g. human resourses, machinery etc).
- Capability of communication between citizens and municipality as well as of communication between employees and the city counsil.
- Faster execution and maintainance of projects.
- Optimization and management of financial resourses and raw materials.
- Minimizing bureaucracy.
- Better insurance and protection of the municipality's files.
## System Requirements Analysis
- **Functional Requirements :** The functional requirements are specifically important as they define the functionality of the system. During the phase of design several meatings with the people in charge in the municipality took place in order to define which are the exact desired functionalities of the system. So we came up with the following plan.
  - Guest : A guest can have access to all general information and data which are not require further access to the system (lon in).
  - Low level user : A low level user can be a citizen or an emplyee and can have access in specific fucntionalities according to his status. For citizens,
    - They have the right of resister (sign up) or delete which must be accepted by the administrator.
    - They can log in to the system only with registration data.
    - They have only one account per citizen.
    - They can send requests of a technical nature.
    - They can send requests of complaining if the above requests are not satisfied.
    - They can watch the status of the requests.
