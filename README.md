# Analysis-and-Design-a-Real-System-using-UML
The goal of this project is to analyze and design a whole real software system that can be in use from any local authority service in a city or a town such as the **Municipality** in terms of optimizing the services that the minicipality provides to the people and all the benefits people can receive from their local aythority service, using the UML (Unified Modeling Language). Our analysis and design on this system is focused in the need of the **Technical Service** of the municipality which is responsible for scheduling, studying, building and supervising projects that will be in great benefit to the people and improve radically their every day lives. Additionally, the technical servise is responsible for preserving the public buildings in good condition, keeping the public spaces clean and taking care of all the green fields and areas in the city or town.
